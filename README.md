Project Overview

The goal of this project is to predict whether a bank customer will subscribe to a term deposit based on their demographic and financial characteristics. The solution leverages several machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Boosting algorithms.

Main Steps
Data Preparation
Data cleaning, encoding categorical features, and creating new useful features.
Model Training
Building a baseline Logistic Regression model.
Comparing performance with more complex models such as Random Forest and Boosting.
Hyperparameter tuning for model optimization.
Model Evaluation
The main evaluation metric is the AUC Score, measuring the classification quality.
The confusion matrix is used for detailed error analysis.
Visualization & Interpretation
Analyzing feature importance and interpreting model results.
Dataset
The dataset is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and contains information about direct marketing campaigns (phone calls) by a Portuguese bank. It includes:

Demographic data (age, job, education, marital status, etc.)
Contact history with the bank
Economic indicators
Target variable: whether the client subscribed to a term deposit (yes/no)
Practical Value
Helps the bank identify which clients are most likely to subscribe to a term deposit.
Optimizes marketing campaign costs.
Increases the effectiveness and conversion rate of marketing efforts.
